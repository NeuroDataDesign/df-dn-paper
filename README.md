# When are Deep Networks really better than Random Forests at small sample sizes?
This is preliminary work. More details will be available. GitHub: https://github.com/neurodata/rf-dn-paper

Random forests (RF) and deep networks (DN) are two of the primary machine learning methods in current literature and yield differing levels of performance on different data modalities. We wish to further explore and establish the conditions and domains in which each approach excels, particularly in the context of sample size and feature dimension. To address these issues, we tested the performance of these models across tabular, image, and audio settings using varying model parameters and architectures. Our focus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent most medical problems. In general, we found RF to excel at tabular and audio domains. DN performed better on image data at larger sample sizes.
